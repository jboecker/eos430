Welcome to the eos430 documentation.

If you are new to the project, start with the
[overview](overview.html), then read the [getting started
tutorial.](getting-started.html)

# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome.

* for bug reports, feature requests, and questions, please [create a new
issue on GitHub.](https://github.com/jboecker/eos430/issues/new)

* for patches to the source code or documentation, please submit a pull
request on GitHub.

* if the documentation is confusing or does not include enough
  information for beginners, please open a new issue to point out what
  needs to be explained better. My goal is to make the documentation
  as beginner-friendly as possible -- however, this can be difficult
  from the perspective of the original author of the software.
