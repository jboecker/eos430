# Where to buy MSP430 controllers

The MSP430 Value Line range of microcontrollers is available from the
big electronics distributors such as Digikey, Mouser, Farnell and RS
Components.

The MSP430 Launchpad can also ordered directly from the TI eStore
(last time I checked, they seemed to offer free world-wide shipping
for Launchpads).

## Situation in Germany

In Germany, Farnell and RS Components will only sell to business
customers and for small orders, the international shipping charge when
ordering from Digikey or Mouser dwarfs the value of your items.

* If you are a student at a university, Farnell will make an exception
  for you.

* www.hbe-shop.de offers Farnells catalog to private customers.

* The MSP430 Launchpad development board is available from some shops
  focused on hobby electronics and robotics. I ordered mine from
  www.watterott.com.
