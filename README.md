# eos430

With a **microcontroller running the eos430 firmware** you can
**connect** physical controls such as **toggle switches or push
buttons to your flight simulator** (or other programs) through
[Helios](http://gadrocsworkshop.com/helios).

Helios is a program made by [Gadroc](http://www.gadrocsworkshop.com/)
that allows you to control your flight simulator using a variety of
input devices, including DirectX compatible joysticks, virtual panels
displayed on a touch screen, and custom hardware.

It supports some popular simulators directly and can also simulate key
presses to control anything that has a keyboard shortcut.

[EOS](http://gadrocsworkshop.com/eos) is the name of the protocol used
by custom hardware to talk to Helios over a serial port.

eos430 is an implementation of this protocol for the "MSP430 Value
Line" series of microcontrollers made by Texas Instruments.
